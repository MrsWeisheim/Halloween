   <h2>The History of Halloween</h2> 
   <p> Before christianity stuck it's dirty hands where it didn't belong, the pagans celebrated a similar festival called Samhain. This end of year festival was a time to remember the dead and celebrate the years harvest. At this time the christian church was trying to eliminate all pagan festivals and turn them into religious holidays. Samhain lined up almost perfectly with the christian day "All Hallows Day". All Hollows day which is better known as All Saints day was a day for remembering all the previous Christian Saints. Originally, this was held in the Spring time but Pope Gregory, in an effort to override Samhain, moved All Saints day to Novemeber 1st. </p>

   <h2>The Origin of Costumes</h2>
   <p>The Celtic people believed that the veil between the living and dead became so thin during Samhain, that spirits and fairies could easily pass through into the earthly relm. This was a scary thought. In order to please anything that come through from the other side people would leave food and drinks outside as a peace offering. In order to hide that they were human the Celts would disguse themselves as ghouls and ghosts. This is where costumes got it's start.</p>
